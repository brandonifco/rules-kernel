# `dotnet test` exits 0 when it finds nothing to test. Verified on this SDK (10.0.112):
# an .slnx with zero projects prints "Unable to find a project to restore!" and exits 0.
# The same silent-pass shape is reachable without anything that dramatic: a project can
# stop being part of $SOLUTION (a typo'd path, a dropped <Project> line, an accidental
# Condition) while every *other* test project still runs and passes, and the run still
# reports "ok". Exit code alone is not evidence that this solution's tests ran.
#
# The fix asks two independent questions of the actual test-run output (a TRX file per
# project, requested below), not of the exit code:
#   1. did every test project ON DISK (<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject> in its own
#      .csproj, found by walking the repository) produce a result file? Deriving that
#      expectation from the repository rather than from $SOLUTION is the whole point: a
#      project dropped from the solution also drops out of a count taken FROM the solution,
#      so the expectation falls in step with the actual and the assertion can never fail.
#      Verified -- against a solution-derived expectation, deleting a project line from the
#      slnx still reported PASS.
#   2. did the sum of tests those files record come to more than zero? A solution that
#      declares no test projects at all -- or a result wipeout -- is caught even though
#      (1) is vacuously satisfied.
# Neither question is answerable from "dotnet test exited 0", which is the entire point.

  # -- never got ContinuousIntegrationBuild applied by anything *this script* controls.
  # It happened to come out right when a caller's environment already had CI=true set for
  # the whole step (as build-and-test.yml's Validate step does), because child processes
  # inherit environment variables -- but that made CI parity for the shipped bits an
  # accident of the caller, not a guarantee of the gate. A hermetic gate should not depend
  # on what its caller's shell already exported.

  # So: force CI=true on the Release pass explicitly, regardless of the ambient
  # environment. This is also the exact configuration `publish.yml` now rebuilds before
  # packing (see that workflow's `publish` job), so what gets tested here, right down to
  # ContinuousIntegrationBuild's source-path normalisation, is what gets shipped. Nothing
  # from the old Release-without-CI pass is lost: optimisation-level coverage (the original
