# The vectors that pin the kernel's replay contract must come from the reference
# implementation, not from anybody's recollection of it. So this script fetches
# imneme/pcg-c-basic at a pinned commit, verifies the two files it uses by SHA-256,
# compiles them together with gen_vectors.c, and transcribes the program's output
# mechanically into C#.
#
# The reference is fetched, never vendored: it is third-party Apache-2.0 code, and
# committing it would make this repository a redistributor for no benefit. What this repository
# keeps is the derived facts and the exact recipe for re-deriving them.
#
# Not part of ./scripts/validate.sh: this needs network access and a C compiler, and the
# canonical gate must stay hermetic. Run it when the vectors are questioned, not on
# every build.
